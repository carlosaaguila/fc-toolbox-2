function [dist,leader_ana] = get_spike_networks(summ,disc)

%% To do
%{ 
- think about optimizing gamma (right now using 1)
- decide the localization of the cluster (mode location??)
- see what they do with sleep
- get actual dot product

- find lower and higher RL channels in each cluster, see if their spike
rates go up with sleep. If lower goes up, then that means more independent
spikes. If higher goes up disproportionately, then more spread.
- correlation between RL in each cluster and spike increase with sleep
